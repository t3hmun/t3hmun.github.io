# t3hmun's web-log

This is the source for my web-log.

It is generated using my static site generator.

The easiest way to install it is to install it globally via npm (requires NodeJs 6+):

```bash
$ npm install -g t3h-static-site-generator
```

That links a single command `t3hpub`.

```bash
$ t3hpub
```

With that single commant the site is generated:

* Web-log posts generated from markdown, with syntax highlighting.
* Pages and templates generated using Pug.
* CSS themes generated from using Less.
